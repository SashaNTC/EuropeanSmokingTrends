Power BI Dashboard: European Smoking Trends

Short description: Structure data of smokers in Europe processing and analysis. All facts are grouped and structured to surface clearer view of rate delivery of European smokers, by many criteria. 
Project Goals: 
-	Total rate of smokers in Europe. There are data from 2014 and data from 2019 in order to see trends
-	Rate of smokers in each state
-	Age delivery
-	Gender delivery
-	All data are interactive. Filters may influence data or switch it off.
